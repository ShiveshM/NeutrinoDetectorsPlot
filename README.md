# Neutrino Detector Livingston Plots

Inspired by the [famous plot][1] of M. Stanley Livingston showing accelerator
center-of-mass energy as a function of time, our plots show the progressions of
neutrino detector fiducial mass and interaction vertex resolution.

This data was collected by hand â€“ skimming old papers and making ballpark calculations for the vertex resolution. For more info on the dataset and our methodology, see our [presentation slides][3].

This work was performed as a part of the [2017 International Neutrino Summer
School at Fermilab][2]. Thanks to Professor Mark Messier for the idea.
