# Neutrino Detector Livingston Plots

Inspired by the [famous plot][1] of M. Stanley Livingston showing accelerator
center-of-mass energy as a function of time, our plots show the progressions of
neutrino detector fiducial mass and interaction vertex resolution.

This work was performed as a part of the [2017 International Neutrino Summer
School at Fermilab][2]. Thanks to Professor Mark Messier for the idea.
